/*
Hint 1
We need to return the element from an array that passes a function. Both the function and the array are passed into our function findElement(arr, func). Looking through the array can be done with a for loop.

Hint 2
num is passed to the function. We will need to set it to the elements we want to check with the function.

Hint 3
Do not forget, if none of the numbers in the array pass the test, it should return undefined.

Challenge asks us to look through array. This is done using a for loop.
The num variable is being passed into the function, so we set it to each index in our array.
The pre-defined function( called func) already checks each number for us, so if it is “true”, we return that num.
If none of the numbers in the array pass the function’s test, we return undefined.
