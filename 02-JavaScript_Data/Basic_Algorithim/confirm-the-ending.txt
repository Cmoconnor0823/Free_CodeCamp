/*
Code Explanation
1) Make a reg ex pattern from the target variable that exists at the end of the string str.

2) Since we will use a variable that will change the pattern each time the function is called, we will use the constructor of the regular expression object new RegExp(pattern[, flags]), so we start with: new RegExp(target).

3) Then we have to check at the end of the string, so we concatenate to the target variable the $ character to match the end: new RegExp(target+'$').

4) We use the flag i to ignore the case of the pattern and we have our completed RegExp: new RegExp(target+'$','i'), or we can ommit the flag entirely.

5) Finally, we are using our regular expression with the test method to the given string, to check if the string ends with the pattern and return true or false accordingly.
