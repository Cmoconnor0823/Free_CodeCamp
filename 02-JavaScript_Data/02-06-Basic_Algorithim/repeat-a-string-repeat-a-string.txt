/*
Hint 1
The program is very simple, we have to take a variable and return that variable being repeated certain amount of times. No need to add space or anything, just keep repeating it into one single string.

Hint 2
You canâ€™t edit strings, you will need to create a variable to store the new string.

Hint 3
Create a loop to repeat the code as many times as needed.

Hint 4
Make the variable created store the current value and append the word to it.
