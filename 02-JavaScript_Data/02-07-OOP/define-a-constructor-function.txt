/*
**Constructors are functions that create new objects.

**Constructors are defined with a capitalized name to distinguish them from other functions that are not constructors.

**Constructors use the keyword this to set properties of the object they will create. Inside the constructor, this refers to the new object it will create.

**Constructors define properties and behaviors instead of returning a value as other functions might.
