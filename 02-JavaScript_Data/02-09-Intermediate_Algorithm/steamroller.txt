/*
This problem seems simple but you need to make sure to flatten any array, regardless of the level which is what adds a bit of difficulty to the problem.

Hint 1
You need to check if an element is an array or not.

Hint 2
If you are dealing with an array, then you need flatten it by getting the value inside of the array. This means if you have [[4]] then instead of returning [4] you need to return 4. If you get [[[4]]] then the same, you want the 4. You can access it with arr[index1][index2] to go a level deeper.

Hint 3
You will definitely need recursion or another way to go beyond two level arrays to make the code flexible and not hard-coded to the answers needed. Have fun!
