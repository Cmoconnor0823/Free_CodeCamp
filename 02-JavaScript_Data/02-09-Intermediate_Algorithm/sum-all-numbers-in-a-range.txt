/*Hints
Hint 1
Use Math.max() to find the maximum value of two numbers.

Hint 2
Use Math.min() to find the minimum value of two numbers.

Hint 3
Remember to that you must add all the numbers in between so this would require a way to get those numbers.

function sumAll(arr) {

  //First create a variable to store the max number between two numbers in the array
  var max = Math.max(arr[0], arr[1]);

  //Then create a variable to store the min number between two numbers in the array
  var min = Math.min(arr[0], arr[1]);

  //Create a holding spot for adding the numbers together
  var holdingSpot = 0;

  for (var i = min; i <= max; i++) {
    holdingSpot += i;
  }
  return holdingSpot;
}

sumAll([1, 4]);
console.log(sumAll([1, 4]));



/* OR
const sumAll = arr => {
  // Buckle up everything to one!
  const startNum = arr[0];
  const endNum = arr[1];

  // Get the count of numbers between the two numbers by subtracting them and add 1 to the absolute value.
  // ex. There are |1-4| + 1 = 4, (1, 2, 3, 4), 4 numbers between 1 and 4.
  const numCount = Math.abs(startNum - endNum) + 1;

  // Using Arithmetic Progression summing formula
  const sum = ((startNum + endNum) * numCount) / 2;
  return sum;
};


The formula for calculating the sum of a continuous range is “(startNum + endNum) * numCount / 2”.
arr[0] and arr[1] can either be startNum or endNum, order doesn’t matter.
We can get the count of numbers in range by “Math.abs(arr[0] - arr[1]) + 1”.
Applying the formula by plugging in the numbers.
