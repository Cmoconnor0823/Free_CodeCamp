/*
Hints
Hint 1
Create an array with all the numbers that are missing from the original array to make it easier to check when having to check for even division.

Hint 2
You can use remainder operator (%) to check if the reminder of a division is 0, which means it is evenly divisible.

Hint 3
If you sort the array from greatest to smallest, then you can use the first two numbers as a first check for the smallest common multiple. This is because they are more likely to be the smallest common multiple than the lower numbers.
