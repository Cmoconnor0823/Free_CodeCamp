/*
Problem Explanation
While the second argument is not true, you will have to remove the first element from the left of the array that was passed as the first argument.


Hint 1
You can use Array.prototype.shift() or filter that you should be more familiar with to solve this problem in a few lines of code.

Hint 2
Shift returns the element that was removed which we don’t really need, all we need is the modified array that is left.

Hint 3
If you still can’t figure out how to solve it with shift, then try solving it with filter, and check how filter works, if you become familiar with it, then you can make the code with shift.

function dropElements(arr, func) {
  // create a for loop that will iterate over the given array
  for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)
  // the write an if statement that passes the item at the index of ther array we are looping through to the given function, if that given function returns true for the arr[i] value, then slice the array at that index 
    if (func(arr[i])) return arr.slice(i);
// if nothing passes the given function return an empty array
  return [];
}

dropElements([1, 2, 3], function(n) {return n < 3; });
