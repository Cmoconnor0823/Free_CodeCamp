/*
Hint 1
You will need to convert from character to ASCII code using the two methods provided in the description.

Hint 2
You will have to check for the difference in ASCII code as they are in order. Using a chart would be very helpful.

Hint 3
You will need to figure out where the missing letter is, along with handling the case that there is not missing letter as it needs an specific return value.
