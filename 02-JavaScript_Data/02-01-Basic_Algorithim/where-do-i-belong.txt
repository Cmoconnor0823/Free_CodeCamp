/*

Hint 1
The first thing to do is sort the array from lower to bigger, just to make the code easier. This is where sort comes in, it needs a callback function so you have to create it.

Hint 2
Once the array is sorted, then just check for the first number that is bigger and return the index.

Hint 3
If there is no index for that number then you will have to deal with that case too.
