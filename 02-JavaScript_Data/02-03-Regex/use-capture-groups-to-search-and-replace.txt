/*Hint 1
You will need three capture groups to accomplish this task.

Hint 2
Each capture group will need to be separated by a space character.

Hint 3
The replacement string will use the $ syntax 3 times.*/

// () capture group -- we need 3
// /s  to account for space in the string --- we need 2
// /w+   one ore more characters can be found in the capture group
// line 3 has us using $ to reference the capture groups with 1 being the first group and 3 being the last group
