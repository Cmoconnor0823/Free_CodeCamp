/*
Hints

This function takes in an array of sub arrays first. For each sub array the function uses the element and searches the sub arrays for a match of the element. If no match is found it will create a new array with the subarray that doesnt match the element. then it will return the new array

Hint 1
A nested for loop must be used to search through every element in the array.
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {}

Hint 2
Every element of the array must then be compared to the elem parameter passed through the filteredArray() function.
if (arr[i].indexOf(elem) == -1) {
}

elem == -1 meaning the index of was unable to find the sub array 

Hint 3
If a match is NOT found then newArr have that entire subarray added. The push() function is very useful here.
newArr.push(arr[i]);
Once that entire subarray is added to newArr the loop continue with the next element.
