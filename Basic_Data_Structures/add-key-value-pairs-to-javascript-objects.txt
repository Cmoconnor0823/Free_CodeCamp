/*
key value pairs---- this is important terminology
 foods above has 4 properties with 4 values

Hint 1
The foods object has already been declared. All that is left to be done is to add three new key-values.
OBJECT[{ KEY }] = { VALUE };
The above code will create a ney key-value within the object.
