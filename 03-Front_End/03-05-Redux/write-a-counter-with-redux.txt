/*
Hint 1
The best way to solve this challenge is by reviewing previous redux lessons particularly the following:

Use const for Action Types 
Use a Switch Statement to Handle Multiple Actions 
Define an Action Creator 
Handle an Action in the Store 
Create a Redux Store 
*/


// define a constant for increment action types
const INCREMENT = "INCREMENT"; 

// define a constant for decrement action types
const DECREMENT = "DECREMENT"; 

 // define the counter reducer which will increment or decrement the state based on the action it receives
const counterReducer = (state = 0 , action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case INCREMENT:
    return (state += 1);

    case DECREMENT:
    return (state -= 1);

    default:
    return state;
  }
};

// define an action creator for incrementing
const incAction = () => {
  return {
    type: INCREMENT
  };
}; 

// define an action creator for decrementing
const decAction = () => {
  return {
    type: DECREMENT
  };
}; 

// define the Redux store here, passing in your reducers
const store = Redux.createStore(counterReducer);
