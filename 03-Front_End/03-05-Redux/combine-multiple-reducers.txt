/*
Problem Explanation
The goal of this challenge is to combine two reducers into a single reducer which will be passed into the Redux.createStore() method.

Hints
Hint 1
Use the method Redux.combineReducers(). Pass an object as an argument.

Hint 2
The object should have two name:value pairs. The value corresponds to the reducer function

    case DECREMENT:
      return state - 1;

const authReducer = (state = {authenticated: false}, action) => {

// define the root reducer here
