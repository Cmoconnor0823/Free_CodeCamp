                Before you can start coding your first line, you will need a Code Editing Program.
                It can be something as simple as a program that can write plain text like Note Pad, but there are
                many other programs that can help you as you write code.

            <p>
                Wikipedia.org has this to say about code editors- <br>
                "A source-code editor is a text editor program designed specifically for editing source
                code of computer programs. It may be a standalone application or it may be built into an
                integrated development environment (IDE) or web browser. Source-code editors are a fundamental
                programming tool, as the fundamental job of programmers is to write and edit source code. </p>
            <p>
                Source-code editors have features specifically designed to simplify and speed up typing of source code,
                such as syntax highlighting, indentation, autocomplete and brace matching functionality. These editors
                also provide a convenient way to run a compiler, interpreter, debugger, or other program relevant for
                the software-development process. So, while many text editors like Notepad can be used to edit source
                code, if they don't enhance, automate or ease the editing of code, they are not source-code editors.

                A web browser (commonly referred to as a browser) is a software application for accessing informatio
                on the World Wide Web. When a user requests a web page from a particular website, the web browser
                retrieves the necessary content from a web server and then displays the page on the user's device.
            </p>

            <p>
                A web browser is not the same thing as a search engine, though the two are often confused. For a
                user, a search engine is just a website that provides links other websites. However, to connect
                to a website's server and display its web pages, a user must have a web browser installed.

                A web hosting service is a type of Internet hosting service that allows individuals and organizations
                to make their website accessible via the World Wide Web. Web hosts are companies that provide space on
                a server owned or leased for use by clients, as well as providing Internet connectivity, typically in a
                data center. Web hosts can also provide data center space and connectivity to the Internet for other
                servers located in their data center, called colocation, also known as Housing in Latin America or
                France.
            </p>
            <p>
                The most basic is web page and small-scale file hosting, where files can be uploaded via File Transfer
                Protocol (FTP) or a Web interface. The files are usually delivered to the Web "as is" or with minimal
                processing. Many Internet service providers (ISPs) offer this service free to subscribers. Individuals
                and organizations may also obtain Web page hosting from alternative service providers.
                <br>
                Free web hosting service is offered by different companies with limited services, sometimes supported by
                advertisements, and often limited when compared to paid hosting.
                <br>
                Single page hosting is generally sufficient for personal web pages. Personal web site hosting is
                typically free, advertisement-sponsored, or inexpensive. Business web site hosting often has a higher
                expense depending upon the size and type of the site.

                Now let's begin coding!
                First open your code editor of choice and create a document called <code>index.html</code>
                <br>
                Now you will need to add in the <code>DOCTYPE</code> that you need in this case enter
                <code>
                    <br>
                   < !DOCTYPE html>
                   <br>
                < html lang="en">
                <br>
                 < head>
                 <br>
                 < meta charset="UTF-8">
                 <br>
                 < meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
                 <br>
                 < title>Document</title>
                 <br>
                 < /head>
                 <br>
                 < /html>
                </code>
                <br>
                After that you will need to enter your <code> body</code> tags in between your head and the closing
                <code>html</code> tag. <br>
                <code>
                    < /head><br>< body><br><br>< /body><br>< /html>
                </code>
            </p>
            <p>
                Now lets say Hello to the internet by adding "Hello World" to our site by using a header (h1) tag.
                You will want to place this between your <code> < body> < /body> </code> html tags. <br>
                <br>
                For example: <br>
                <code> < body> <br> < h1> Hello World! < /h1><br> < /body></code>
            </p>
